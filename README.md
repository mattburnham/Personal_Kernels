	My Capstone Project: LEUKOCYTE CELL CLASSIFICATION FOR RAPID SCREENING OF BLOOD CANCER
	Completed 13th March 2020

	Accurate classification of morphological classes of leukocyte cells that are prevalent in the detection of acute myeloid leukemia (AML),being greater than the accuracy and efficiency of a human.

	Q. Whether computer vision/ deep learning / a convolutional neural network has better accuracy and is more time efficient than a human being in the task of classifying blood cells that are prevalent in blood cancers such as AML.
